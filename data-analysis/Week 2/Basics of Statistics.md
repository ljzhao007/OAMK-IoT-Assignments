# Week 2: Basic Statistics Concepts

#### Define mean, median and range

> **Mean**: The average of a set of numbers. There are also multiple types of means: *Weighted mean*; *Harmonic mean*; *Geometric mean*; *Arithmetic-Geometric mean*; *Root-Mean Square mean*; *Heronian mean*.

> **Median**: The exact middle of a set of ordered numbers.

> **Range**: The difference between the highest and lowest value in a data set. In mathematics it can mean the whole range of numbers in a given set.

#### Define standard deviation and variance

> **Standard Deviation (SD)**: A measure that is used to quantify the dispersion of data in a data set. A low SD means that the data tends to the mean of the set, while a high SD means that the data points are spread out over a larger set of values.

> **Variance**: It is a measure of how far the data is spread out from the mean value in a set.

#### What is sample and what is population?

> **Population**: Is the entire set of possible observations that can be made. For example, if we are making a study on students performance in maths this year, the population would be all the students that are studying maths at the moment.

> **Sample**: Is a part of the population on which observations were made based on different parameters. Samples are basically subsets of populations that are managable to study, then the results can be extrapolated to the entire population.

#### What is interquartile range?

> The IQR represents the middle 50% of values in a data set. For example:
`[4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20]`. We divide the set into 3 quartiles, Q1 being the middle of the left half, Q2 being the median of the set and Q3 the middle of the right half. Then, `Q1 = (6+7)/2 = 6.5`, `Q2 = 11`, `Q3 = (15+17)/2 = 11`. This means that `IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 11 - 6.5 = 4.5`

#### What is histogram?

> A histogram is a type of data chart that uses bars to group numbers into ranges. The taller a bar, the more data is in that range.

#### What is bias in statistics?

> **Bias** is the over- or under-estimation of the value in a population parameter. For example, unintenionally for a case-study, you could select mostly people of a color or sex, resulting in a *Selection bias*, which results in having data biased towards that types of people, not reflecting others completely or at all.

#### What is a statistical distribution? What is the most common one?

> It is the distribution of data and the most common one is the Normal Distribution or Bell Distribution.

#### What is the difference between discrete and continous distribution?
