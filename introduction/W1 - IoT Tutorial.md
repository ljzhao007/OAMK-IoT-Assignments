# Week 1 - IoT Tutorial

1. What is IoT?
   * **Internet of Things** - is the concept of a world-wide network of inter-connected devices that communicate. *Eg. a system of lights or heating at home that can be controlled through a mobile app, or turn themselves on or off based on settings put by the user. Another example could be smart cars that communicate with other cars to coordinate in trafic.*
2. What are the most important features of IoT?
   * **Connectivity** - so that all the devices can connect and communicate with each other.
   * **Analysis** - when devices are connected, it is important to have a way of analyzing the data that they process so that we can improve our products, services or lives.
   * **Integration** - so that everyting integrates to improve the user experience
   * **AI** - through AI the system can learn how to behave based on external input and other data recieved. *Eg. a system that teaches itself how you use the heating and in time it will adjust itself to your liking based on that data.*
   * **Sensing** - without sensors the systems could not gather environmental data that need to be used for checking changes that need adjustments.
   * **Active Engagement** - all connected devices or services that can actively engage eachother
   * **Endpoint Management** - a centralized way of managing all endpoint devices, deployment, testing, analysing.
3. Advantages and disadvantages of IoT
    * **Advantages**
      * Security - A well connected system can improve, for eg., home security.
      * Time Saving - Such systems can save huge amounts of time because of the autonomous nature of them.
      * Minimize Human Effort
      * Enhanced Data Collection
      * Better Resource Utilization - monitoring of resource utilization can help in identifying problematic usages and help reduce waste.

    * **Disadvantages**
      * Security - Because of the scale of such systems and the exposure to the whole internet, hey are succeptible to security attacks.
      * Privacy - Because of all the data that these systems gather, it is a problem that, even passively, data of the user is recorded in detail.
      * Compexity - The scale of such systems introduces huge complexity to designing, developing, deploying and managing them.

4. List at least five typical sensors used in IoT
   * Temperature, humidity, pressure, light, motion, UV, electricity, gyro
5. List some typical microcontrollers used in IoT? What is the difference between a microcontroller and microprocessor?
   * Motorola 68HC11, PIC 16F84, Atmel 8051, ATmega328
   * A microprocessor is just a CPU, while the microcontroller has a CPU, timers, clocks, memory, I/O peripherals and others.
6. Define IoT ecosystem.
   * It's the connection of different devices such as smartphones, tablets, sensors, etc. that communicate with each-other over a network. *Eg. a car, a phone, home lights, home heating system, that when the owner comes home, the car closes by itself, the home door opens automatically, lights come on, temperature is already right, etc.*
7. Define the IoT technology stack.
   * The stack consists of: Device Hardware > Device Software > Communication > Cloud Platform > Cloud Applications
   * Basically the Device Software gathers info from the hardware, sends it over the network to a cloud-based server that stores and manipulates the data, which can be seen on Cloud Applicatons.
